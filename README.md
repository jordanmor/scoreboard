# scoreboard
A dynamic scoreboard with a simple stopwatch for playing board or card games. 

Built with React. 

Created a basic react boilerplate from scratch instead of using create-react-app in order to better understand the inner workings of React and it's development dependencies, such as Babel and Webpack.
